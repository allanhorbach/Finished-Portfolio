  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I am learning to become a coder through the wonderful on-line course <strong>THINKFUL. THINKFUL</strong> provides a<strong> mentor</strong>. The word mentor comes from Greek. Mentor was a friend of Odysseus. Sanskrit man-tar means- "one who thinks," the causative form of the root word means *men- "to think"; which is what <strong>THINKFUL</strong> is all about. Teaching you to think! .</p>
  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
  <p>I was asked what my home address was so I answered 127.0.0.1. The person then said he meant my physical address so I answered 08-00-27-0E-25-B8. Oh, and also Minnesota.</p>
  <h2>More About Me</h2>
  <p>I decided to become a developer so I'll never have financial problems. I'll be in a  $.noConflict() mode</p>

  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I think my hobby is to try to do everything to the max. A lot of people take up hobbies and find an excuse not to carry on with it. Once I start something, I won't stop until I'm as good at it. My strength is also my weakness.</p>
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
   <p>I want to do software engineering and work on tough engineering problems with the tool kit my mentor and Thinkful have provided me. Algorithms, data structures, that kind of stuff. I want to work for me or a real cool company. I want to have fun and I want to feel smart and work with smart (but nice) people.
